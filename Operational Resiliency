Hardware Redundancy
	I. Fault Tolerance and Redundancy
		a. Withstand failure of one or more components
		b. More than one
	II. High Availability
		a. How closely does a system achieve 100% uptime


	III. RAID
		a. Redundant array of independent disks
		b. RAID 0 -Striping
			i. Two disc to 32 disks
			ii. Splits data between disks
			iii. Doesn't offer redundancy but is better performance
				1) If one drive goes down you lose all data
				2) No storage overhead
		c. RAID 1 -Mirroring
			i. Complete copy 
			ii. At least two discs
			iii. Duplexing
				1) Give each drive a raid controller
				2) Give redundancy
			iv. Performance decrease
			v. 50% Storage overhead 
		d. RAID 5 - Striping w/ parity
			i. At least three disks
			ii. If one disks failed still operational due to parity has the missing drive 
				1) When replaced failed drive it will rewrite the drive data with the parity
			iii. Fault Tolerance
				1) Unless two drives are lost
			iv. 1/X storage overhead
				1) X = Number of drives
		e. RAID 10 - 0+1
			i. At least four disks
			ii. Strip and mirroring
				1) Two disk Striping
				2) Two disk mirroring strip
			iii. Performance increase
			iv. Redundancy
				1) Till both strips are fail 
	IV. San - Storage Area Network
		a. Collection of Drives


	I. NIC Teaming
		a. Two NICs on one server
		b. Using the same gateway
		c. Used for fault tolerance or for performance 
			i. Can use both NICs at the same time to get faster speed
			ii. If one fails the other  is still there
	II. Load Balancers
		a. Server Cluster is a grouping of servers that disturbs the workload across 
			i. Cluster controller disturbs the workload 
		b. Load Balancer can disturb the incoming request to different clusters
	III. Power Redundancy
		a. Dual power supply
			i. More than one PSU
			ii. For Redundancy
		b. UPS 
			i. Battery Backup
			ii. Power for building is lost then it allows for a graceful shutdown
		c. Server rack
			i. Connects to Managed PDUs
			ii. Able to see the power usage on equipment
		d. Generators
			i. Diesel generator
			ii. Computer equipment requires a stable flow of electric so gas generator won't work 

Site Redundancy
	I. Hot Site
		a. Backup facility
		b. Fully equipped site
			i. Server 
			ii. Storage
			iii. Applications
			iv. Network devices
			v. Telephony systems 
	II. Cold site
		a. Backup Facility
		b. Not equipped
		c. Office space
	III. Warm site
		a. Backup Facility
		b. Mostly equipped
		c. Needs a moderate amount of configuration
	IV. Comparison


	VI. Considerations
		a. Location
			i. Not near the actual site
			ii. Consider natural disasters 
				1) Tornados, Hurricanes, earthquakes, fires
			iii. To get to the location
			iv. Resources around the locations
				1) EMS and 911 response time
				2) Food

Non-persistence concepts 
	I. Last Known Good
		a. Boot configuration state
		b. Uses with boot failures
			i. Revert to last known good state
		c. Mostly used in windows
		d. Will overwrite last known good when logged in
	II. Known State
		a. Revert to Known state
			i. Baselines
			ii. Desired state configuration
				1) Windows specific
				2) Consistent configuration
			iii. Snapshots in VMs
			iv. System restore in windows
	III. Live boot media
		a. Linux live boot
			i. Memory resident operating system
			ii. Doesn't affect internal drive
			iii. Runs in RAM
		b. Reboot will reset and not save 
		c. Recovery environments 
			i. Runs in RAM
		d. Offline antivirus
		e. Media
			i. CD/DVD
			ii. USB
			iii. PXE boot
		f. Virtual desktop
			i. Like a normal desktop but once logged out it will scrub that environment

Backup and Recovery
	I. Backup Types
		a. Specify data to preserve
		b. Archive bit
			i. Saved data before next backup
		c. Start with full backup
		d. Backup time vs restore time
	II. Backup types - Full backup
		a. Clears archive bits
		b. Backup all the data
		c. Doesn't care about archive bits / modifications
			i. backup all data 
		d. Need 1 backup set
		e. Pricey due to storage usage 
	III. Backup types - Differential backup
		a. Finds archive bits / modifications
			i. Only adds those to the backup
		b. Does not clear the archive bits 
			i. Adds it to the next differential backup
			ii. Will keep adding till archive bits are cleared
	IV. Backup types - incremental backup
		a. Clears archive bit
		b. Backups only the new modifications 
		c. Does not add the previous incremental backup 
			i. May need multiple backups to get all data back
